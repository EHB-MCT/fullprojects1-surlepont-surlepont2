						    Recently we met Gianna, Ward and their little dog Dali. Gianna is Italian, Ward a native of Ghent. They got to know this place when they lived in Saint-Guidon. Today they live in la Roue, but they still come to the bridge very regularly, to play with their dog Dali, and to enjoy the sunshine and the view of the canal and the Brussels skyline.

							Sur Le Pont brings the friends of the Pierre Marchant Bridge together virtually! Winston is Swedish, grew up in England but moved to Brussels recently. He lives a ten minutes’ walk from the bridge, and you will meet him here when the sun is out, enjoying the weather and a good book.

							Recently we met friends Anna and Flora. Anna lives in the center of Brussels, Flora and her dog Poutchi in Ixelles. They love to catch up by walking along the canal. And of course, at the end of every walk there is always our lovely bridge for a moment of rest and a drink.

						<p>
							Jef, Katrien, Arnout and Djaina also meet regularly on our bridge. Their story parallels that of countless others we met in recent weeks: they discovered this place especially during the lockdowns, in which the lack of quality green space in our city became so evident. There has been a lot of talk in the past year about the need for perspective, and let's face it, perspective is plentiful here. In addition, a summer with fewer worries looms at the end, and even an outdoor swimming pool.

							This is Joe. He spent a few days in our city, discussing transatlantic relations, climate change and the lowering of import tariffs on beer and waffles. In a trip stacked with meetings, he found the time to visit our bridge, to contemplate on the symbolic meaning of bridges, as they represent equality between two parties and the willingness to reach the other side

							Tonight, the bridge npo Stoepkrijt welcomed. For 5 years, a great team around Ben, Dries, Jonathan, Pieter & Jonas from Molenbeek and Forest has been making sure that people can come together to follow matches of the Red Devils on a big screen. This evening the sidewalk chalks have chosen the bridge as a place. The atmosphere was fantastic, even after the match. Thank you for these beautiful moments!

							Bruno Steinrücke is one of the founders and current president of Semaphore, the only youth centre on the water in Belgium. The houseboat is next to the Marchant Bridge at Quai Biestebroeck. He also lives in a barge located on the Digue du Canal, and is treasurer of the association of the inhabitants of the barges. He has therefore been involved for decades on both sides of the bridge.

							Ah, those two really stole our hearts... Javi (Saint-Gilles) and Marie Cécile (Forest) had their first blind date at our bridge. We don't know if the date was a success, but we know for sure that they discovered one of the most romantic places in the city.

							Pieter lives in Kuregem, a fifteen-minute walk from our bridge. It is the closest public green space to him, and so he often descends on this special place on summer evenings, with a good book or some friends for company.
